What is this?
=============

This file describes the purpose of the several subdirectories that
exist in a default project tree. It is aimed at helping you to
understand how a project is organised internally, and wants to ease
the process of customising the default project skeleton created. First
off, the skeleton created for each project can be found in the
<INSTALL_DIR>/data/skeleton directory. Everything in that directory
will be copied when creating a new project; be careful when modifying
it, so that you don’t accidentally remove required files. The exact
semantic definitions for the directories are as follows:
